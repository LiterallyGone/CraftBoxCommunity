        Craftbox Community was started by two highschool students with a passion for helping people and repurposing everyday objects. One of the founders is an artist herself and decided to start this project because she noticed the piles and piles of old and unused art supplies she no longer works with in her own home. With items becoming increasingly expensive in this economy, the two students hope that Craftbox Community will encourage artists to continue (or start) their creative endeavours in spite of growing art and craft supply prices. Please support their mission!!
