        In need of supplies? We have a couple ways in which you can get art supplies to start your creative journey!
        1. We will post certain dates where we will be at the Mukilteo Library distributing supplies! These dates may vary in the beginning, but we will post on our website and social media!
        2. If you cannot stop by the Mukilteo Library on those certain days, but you still want some art supplies, we may be able to drop off the supplies to you!
        First, go to our "listings page". There, we have taken pictures and listed the descriptions of all our restored art supplies. Look through the supplies for anything that catches your eye
        Second, place an "order". There are no transactions involved, but we request that you order it so we know that someone has requested the supplies! While ordering, we will ask you to supply your name and location of drop off. 
        Thirdly, wait for your order! Because we run a busy schedule, this may take a few days, but we will contact you regarding an estimated time of arrival.

        We are very grateful for anyone who decides to give these art supplies a second chance! Whether you are picking up the supplies at the library, from your home, or another location, we kindly ask you to sign and print your name with each "purchase"!
