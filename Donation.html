              Our project depends on donations from the community!
              There are a couple easy ways to ensure your old art and crafts materials make it into our hands for restoring.

              Similar to the Mukilteo Food Bank, we also have donation boxes at the Mukilteo Library. If you aren't sure where they are located, ask a librarian.
              We will have more boxes in the future, and we will post their locations on this page. Keep your eyes peeled!

            <div class="Donation-type-pickup"><strong>Pick-ups</strong></div>
            <div >
              If you aren't able to travel to our donation boxes (which is our preferred method of donation), do not fret! We will still gladly take your donation. Depending on your location, we may be able to set up a pickup time with you!
              <span class="transition">First</span>, contact us at any time if you have art supplies you want us to pickup.
              <span class="transition">Second</span>, we will set up a time to pick-up art supplies from outside your door. This will usually be on the weekends. 
              <span class="transition">Thirdly</span>, simply place your arts and crafts supplies outside your door and send us the location of pickup!
